### Get Ready For Day 2 - Navigate To Your Project

Building on the project structure from Day 1, enter your `~/pyworkshop` directory, and start your already existing virtual environment.

Windows:

```powershell
> cd $home
> cd pyworkshop
> env\scripts\activate
```

Mac:

```bash
$ cd ~/pyworkshop
$ source env/bin/activate
```

### Open VS Code

If VS Code isn't already open, type the following in the same PowerShell or Terminal window where you activated your virtual environment.

```text
$ code .
```

### Start The REPL

Open the Command Palette in VS Code, and type: "Python: Start REPL"
