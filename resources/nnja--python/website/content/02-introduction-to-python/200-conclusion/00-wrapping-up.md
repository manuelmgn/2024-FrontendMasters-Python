Today you've gotten a whirlwind tour of the Python programming language.

During Day 2, we're going to put our knowledge to work writing real programs.

## Source Control

I highly recommend that you use source control while working on your Python projects. GitHub is a popular and free option.

Source control lets you track changes to your project. You can use that to your advantage to commit early and often and track changes to your project.

If you're not familiar with how to use git or GitHub, you can watch my [Git In-depth Frontend Masters class](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/git-in-depth/). For Python projects, make sure that you use the correct `.gitignore` file. GitHub provides a [free template that you can use](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore).
